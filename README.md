## Project Overview
This project involves performing data analysis, creating OTP Verification System using python and building machine learning models to gain insights and make predictions.

## Data Analysis
The data analysis part involves using SQL to explore and visualize the data.

### SQL
- Data extraction, Data Wrangling and Feature Engineering using SQL.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Visualization of data patterns and trends.

## Python
- OTP Verification System
  
## Machine Learning
Building and evaluating various machine learning models to make predictions.

### Python
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
  
### Models
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost Regressor
  
## Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:
- `sql`: Contains SQL script for data extraction, Data Wrangling, Feature Engineering, EDA, and presentation for visualization.
- `python`: Contains Python script for OTP Verification System.
- `machine_learning`: Contains script for Data cleaning, Preprocessing, EDA with visualizations, building & evaluating machine learning models and A Gradio Application.

## Results
The results of the analysis and machine learning models are documented in the respective directories. Below are some key findings:

- Data trends and patterns identified using SQL.
- Successful otp verification using Python.
- Predictive performance of different machine learning models via Gradio Application.
